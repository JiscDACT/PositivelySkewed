# Learning Python and Statistical Concepts using Google Colab

Google Colab allows anyone to write and execute Python code through a browser meaning no setup is required and you can get coding straight away üòä. 
The notebooks have been designed to introduce some programming and statistical concepts and allow you to practice within the notebook.

Folders containing the workbooks will be added for the following topics:

* Python essentials: [‚úÖAvailable]
* Stats 101: [‚úÖAvailable]
* Stats 102: [‚ùåtbc]
* Stats 103: [‚ùåtbc]
* Python Visualizations: [‚ùåtbc]
* Advanced Python coding: [‚ùåtbc]
